              - Configuration error details
              - Template error details and status of device

      - "get_template_info" gets template(s) info for a list of devices
          - Applicable only to devices in template groups
          - For each device, gets the following details:
              - Name of group that the device and template belong to
              - Name of template on Central
              - Hash code of template

              - Device model for which template is applicable
              - Device firmware versions for which the template is
                applicable

      - "get_templates_for_groups" gets template(s) info for devices in
        qualified groups
          - Applicable only to devices in template groups
          - For each device that belongs to the qualified groups,
            gets the same info as "get_template_info" action
          - Can (and perhaps should) be used with EITHER
            "include_groups" OR "exclude_groups"
              - If neither is specified, all groups are qualified
          - "include_groups" is used to specify a list of qualified
            groups
          - "exclude_groups" is used to specify that all groups except
            for the mentioned groups are qualified

      - "get_templates_using_hash" gets template(s) info for devices
        that are using the qualified template(s)
          - Applicable only to devices in template groups
          - For each device using a qualified template (as specified by
            template hash), gets the same info as "get_template_info"
            action
          - Can (and perhaps should) be used with "exclude_hash"
              - If "exclude_hash" is true, all templates are qualified
                except the one with the given hash
              - If "exclude_hash" is false, only the template with the
                given hash is qualified

      - "get_variablised_switch_template" gets the variablised template
        for an AOS-S switch as multipart/form-data
          - Returns both the template and the variables information

      - "set_switch_ssh_connection" sets an AOS-S switch's SSH username
        and password

      - "move_devices" moves devices (specified as a list of serial
        numbers) to a group
